# First-Scratch-Project-Bug-Begone
My first Scratch project as I begin my coding adventure with Harvard's CS50 course!
# My scratch project is a game called Bug Begone. The user first must having a working webcam and some room to move around. Once started, the user may pick between "easy", "medium", or "hard". The object of the game is to gain points by swatting at the bugs. As the levels increase, more bugs are introduced. The "hard" level includes wasps, that deduct 2 points if swatted at.
